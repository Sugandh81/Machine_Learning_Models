Linear Regression and Gradient Descent



Linear regression is a powerful and interpretable statistical model that allows the machine learning expert to use multiple continuous variables to predict a target value with high precision. There are multiple ways to find a solution for linear regression, but will focus on an popular optimization method called gradient descent. Gradient descent in general can be used for multiple machine learning problems and it will be tailored to the linear regression algorithm through the use of a specific objective function, i.e. mean-squared error.

 Objectives 
- Implement a function to create a design matrix 
- Implement, and visualize a loss function (mean-squared error)
- Implement a function to calculate gradient for each datapoint
- Implement a function to perform gradient descent update
- Visualize gradient descent as it converges to a solution
- Train a linear regression model and use it to make predictions
